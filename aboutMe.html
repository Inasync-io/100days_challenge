      <p>
        Hello! My name is <b>Rohit.</b> I am a Full Stack Developer with
        <mark>2 years of experience</mark>, specializing in the
        <u>MERN stack.</u> <br />
        While I work across the stack, my passion lies in frontend development
        and UI design, where I focus on creating responsive, accessible, and
        visually appealing user experiences.
        I have worked on real‑time projects such as matrimony platforms,
        warranty registration systems, and employee management solutions,
        ensuring performance, security, and user‑friendly design. Alongside
        development, <i>I also explore design tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and to bring ideas
        to life.</i>
